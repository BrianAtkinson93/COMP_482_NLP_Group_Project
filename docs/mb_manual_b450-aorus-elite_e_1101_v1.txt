• Make sure that the motherboard supports the CPU.
(Go to GIGABYTE's website for the latest CPU support list.)
• Always turn off the computer and unplug the power cord from the power outlet before installing the
CPU to prevent hardware damage.
• Locate the pin one of the CPU. The CPU cannot be inserted if oriented incorrectly.
• Apply an even and thin layer of thermal grease on the surface of the CPU.
• Do not turn on the computer if the CPU cooler is not installed, otherwise overheating and damage
of the CPU may occur.
• Set the CPU host frequency in accordance with the CPU specifications. It is not recommended
that the system bus frequency be set beyond hardware specifications since it does not meet the
standard requirements for the peripherals. If you wish to set the frequency beyond the standard
specifications, please do so according to your hardware specifications including the CPU, graphics
card, memory, hard drive, etc.

1-4 Installing the Memory
Read the following guidelines before you begin to install the memory:
• Make sure that the motherboard supports the memory. It is recommended that memory of the
same capacity, brand, speed, and chips be used.
(Go to GIGABYTE's website for the latest supported memory speeds and memory modules.)
• Always turn off the computer and unplug the power cord from the power outlet before installing the
memory to prevent hardware damage.
• Memory modules have a foolproof design. A memory module can be installed in only one direction.
If you are unable to insert the memory, switch the direction.
Dual Channel Memory Configuration
This motherboard provides four memory sockets and supports Dual Channel Technology. After the memory
is installed, the BIOS will automatically detect the specifications and capacity of the memory. Enabling Dual
Channel memory mode will double the original memory bandwidth.
The four memory sockets are divided into two channels and each channel has two memory sockets as following:
 Channel A: DDR4_2, DDR4_4
 Channel B: DDR4_1, DDR4_3

will be heard if no problem is detected at system startup.
• HD (Hard Drive Activity LED, Blue):
Connects to the hard drive activity LED on the chassis front panel. The LED is on when the hard drive
is reading or writing data.
• RES (Reset Switch, Green):
Connects to the reset switch on the chassis front panel. Press the reset switch to restart the computer
if the computer freezes and fails to perform a normal restart.
• CI (Chassis Intrusion Header, Gray):
Connects to the chassis intrusion switch/sensor on the chassis that can detect if the chassis cover has
been removed. This function requires a chassis with a chassis intrusion switch/sensor.
• NC (Orange): No Connection.
The front panel design may differ by chassis. A front panel module mainly consists of power switch,
reset switch, power LED, hard drive activity LED, speaker and etc. When connecting your chassis
front panel module to this header, make sure the wire assignments and the pin assignments are
matched correctly.
14) F_AUDIO (Front Panel Audio Header)
The front panel audio header supports High Definition audio (HD). You may connect your chassis front
panel audio module to this header. Make sure the wire assignments of the module connector match the
pin assignments of the motherboard header. Incorrect connection between the module connector and the
motherboard header will make the device unable to work or even damage it.

15) BAT (Battery)
The battery provides power to keep the values (such as BIOS configurations, date, and time information)
in the CMOS when the computer is turned off. Replace the battery when the battery voltage drops to a low
level, or the CMOS values may not be accurate or may be lost.
You may clear the CMOS values by removing the battery:
1. Turn off your computer and unplug the power cord.
2. Gently remove the battery from the battery holder and wait for one minute. (Or use a
metal object like a screwdriver to touch the positive and negative terminals of the battery
holder, making them short for 5 seconds.)
3. Replace the battery.
4. Plug in the power cord and restart your computer.
• Always turn off your computer and unplug the power cord before replacing the battery.
• Replace the battery with an equivalent one. Damage to your devices may occur if the battery is
replaced with an incorrect model.
• Contact the place of purchase or local dealer if you are not able to replace the battery by yourself
or uncertain about the battery model.
• When installing the battery, note the orientation of the positive side (+) and the negative side (-)
of the battery (the positive side should face up).
• Used batteries must be handled in accordance with local environmental regulations.
16) CLR_CMOS (Clear CMOS Jumper)
Use this jumper to clear the BIOS configuration and reset the CMOS values to factory defaults. To clear
the CMOS values, use a metal object like a screwdriver to touch the two pins for a few seconds.
Open: Normal
Short: Clear CMOS Values
• Always turn off your computer and unplug the power cord from the power outlet before clearing
the CMOS values.
• After system restart, go to BIOS Setup to load factory defaults (select Load Optimized Defaults) or
manually configure the BIOS settings (refer to Chapter 2, "BIOS Setup," for BIOS configurations).
17) F_USB30 (USB 3.1 Gen 1 Header)
The header conforms to USB 3.1 Gen 1 and USB 2.0 specification and can provide two USB ports. For
purchasing the optional 3.5" front panel that provides two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports, please contact the local
dealer.

Chapter 2 BIOS Setup
BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) records hardware parameters of the system in the CMOS on the
motherboard. Its major functions include conducting the Power-On Self-Test (POST) during system startup,
saving system parameters and loading operating system, etc. BIOS includes a BIOS Setup program that allows
the user to modify basic system configuration settings or to activate certain system features.
When the power is turned off, the battery on the motherboard supplies the necessary power to the CMOS to
keep the configuration values in the CMOS.
To access the BIOS Setup program, press the <Delete> key during the POST when the power is turned on.
To upgrade the BIOS, use either the GIGABYTE Q-Flash or @BIOS utility.
• Q-Flash allows the user to quickly and easily upgrade or back up BIOS without entering the operating system.
• @BIOS is a Windows-based utility that searches and downloads the latest version of BIOS from the Internet
and updates the BIOS.
• Because BIOS flashing is potentially risky, if you do not encounter problems using the current version of BIOS,
it is recommended that you not flash the BIOS. To flash the BIOS, do it with caution. Inadequate BIOS flashing
may result in system malfunction.
• It is recommended that you not alter the default settings (unless you need to) to prevent system instability or other
unexpected results. Inadequately altering the settings may result in system's failure to boot. If this occurs, try to
clear the CMOS values and reset the board to default values. (Refer to the "Load Optimized Defaults" section in
this chapter or introductions of the battery/clear CMOS jumper in Chapter 1 for how to clear the CMOS values.)
2-1 Startup Screen
The following startup Logo screen will appear when the computer boots.
(Sample BIOS Version: E2)
Function Keys
There are two different BIOS modes as follows and you can use the <F2> key to switch between the two modes.
The Classic Setup mode provides detailed BIOS settings. You can press the arrow keys on your keyboard to move
among the items and press <Enter> to accept or enter a sub-menu. Or you can use your mouse to select the item you
want. Easy Mode allows users to quickly view their current system information or to make adjustments for optimum
performance. In Easy Mode, you can use your mouse to move through configuration items.
• When the system is not stable as usual, select the Load Optimized Defaults item to set your system to its defaults.
• The BIOS Setup menus described in this chapter are for reference only and may differ by BIOS version.

2-3 M.I.T.
Whether the system will work stably with the overclock/overvoltage settings you made is dependent on your overall
system configurations. Incorrectly doing overclock/overvoltage may result in damage to CPU, chipset, or memory
and reduce the useful life of these components. This page is for advanced users only and we recommend you not to
alter the default settings to prevent system instability or other unexpected results. (Inadequately altering the settings
may result in system's failure to boot. If this occurs, clear the CMOS values and reset the board to default values.)

With the correct BIOS settings, you are ready to install the operating system.
Installing the Operating System
As some operating systems already include RAID/AHCI driver, you do not need to install separate RAID/AHCI
driver during the Windows installation process. After the operating system is installed, we recommend that you
install all required drivers from the motherboard driver disk using "Xpress Install" to ensure system performance
and compatibility. If the operating system to be installed requires that you provide additional RAID/AHCI driver
during the OS installation process, please refer to the steps below:
1. Copy the Hw10 folder under the \Boot folder in the driver disk to your USB thumb drive.
2. Boot from the Windows setup disk and perform standard OS installation steps. When the screen requesting
you to load the driver appears, select Browse.
3. Insert the USB thumb drive and then browse to the location of the driver. The location of the drivers is as
follows:
\Hw10\RAID\x64
4. Select AMD-RAID Bottom Device first and click Next to load the driver. Then select AMD-RAID Controller
and click Next to load the driver. Finally, continue the OS installation.
