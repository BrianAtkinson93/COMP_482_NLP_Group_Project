14) F_PANEL (Front Panel Header)
Connect the power switch, reset switch, speaker, chassis intrusion switch/sensor and system status indicator
on the chassis to this header according to the pin assignments below. Note the positive and negative pins
before connecting the cables.
• PLED/PWR_LED (Power LED, Yellow/Purple):
Power LED Power Switch Speaker
System Status LED Connects to the power status indicator
S0 On on the chassis front panel. The LED is on when the system is operating. The LED is S3/S4/S5 Off off when the system is in S3/S4 sleep state +DELP -DELP +WP -WP +KAEPS CN CN -KAEPS
or powered off (S5).

Connects to the power switch on the chassis front panel. You may
configure the way to turn off your system using the power switch (refer -DH +SER +IC +DEL_RWP -DEL_RWP -DEL_RWP
+DH -SER -IC
to Chapter 2, "BIOS Setup," "Power," for more information).
• SPEAK (Speaker, Orange):
Hard Drive Reset Power LED Connects to the speaker on the chassis front panel. The system reports
Activity LED Switch Chassis Intrusion system startup status by issuing a beep code. One single short beep
Header will be heard if no problem is detected at system startup.
• HD (Hard Drive Activity LED, Blue):
Connects to the hard drive activity LED on the chassis front panel. The LED is on when the hard drive
is reading or writing data.
• RES (Reset Switch, Green):
Connects to the reset switch on the chassis front panel. Press the reset switch to restart the computer
if the computer freezes and fails to perform a normal restart.
• CI (Chassis Intrusion Header, Gray):
Connects to the chassis intrusion switch/sensor on the chassis that can detect if the chassis cover has
been removed. This function requires a chassis with a chassis intrusion switch/sensor.
• NC (Orange): No Connection.
The front panel design may differ by chassis. A front panel module mainly consists of power switch,
reset switch, power LED, hard drive activity LED, speaker and etc. When connecting your chassis
front panel module to this header, make sure the wire assignments and the pin assignments are
matched correctly.
15) F_AUDIO (Front Panel Audio Header)
The front panel audio header supports High Definition audio (HD). You may connect your chassis front
panel audio module to this header. Make sure the wire assignments of the module connector match the
pin assignments of the motherboard header. Incorrect connection between the module connector and the
motherboard header will make the device unable to work or even damage it.

1. Turn off your computer and unplug the power cord.
2. Gently remove the battery from the battery holder and wait for one minute. (Or use
a metal object like a screwdriver to touch the positive and negative terminals of the
battery holder, making them short for 5 seconds.)

• Always turn off your computer and unplug the power cord before replacing the battery.
• Replace the battery with an equivalent one. Damage to your devices may occur if the battery is
replaced with an incorrect model. (cid:31)(cid:31)_3(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)(cid:31)U(cid:31)
• Contact the place of purchase or local dealer if you are not able to replace the battery by yourself
or uncertain about the battery model.
• When installing the battery, note the orientation of the positive side (+) and the negative side (-)
of the battery (the positive side should face up).
• Used batteries must be handled in accordance with local environmental regulations.

Chapter 2 BIOS Setup
BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) records hardware parameters of the system in the CMOS on the
motherboard. Its major functions include conducting the Power-On Self-Test (POST) during system startup,
saving system parameters and loading operating system, etc. BIOS includes a BIOS Setup program that allows
the user to modify basic system configuration settings or to activate certain system features.
When the power is turned off, the battery on the motherboard supplies the necessary power to the CMOS to
keep the configuration values in the CMOS.
To access the BIOS Setup program, press the <Delete> key during the POST when the power is turned on.
To upgrade the BIOS, use either the GIGABYTE Q-Flash or @BIOS utility.
• Q-Flash allows the user to quickly and easily upgrade or back up BIOS without entering the operating system.
• @BIOS is a Windows-based utility that searches and downloads the latest version of BIOS from the Internet
and updates the BIOS.
• Because BIOS flashing is potentially risky, if you do not encounter problems using the current version of BIOS,
it is recommended that you not flash the BIOS. To flash the BIOS, do it with caution. Inadequate BIOS flashing
may result in system malfunction.
• It is recommended that you not alter the default settings (unless you need to) to prevent system instability or other
unexpected results. Inadequately altering the settings may result in system's failure to boot. If this occurs, try to
clear the CMOS values and reset the board to default values. (Refer to the "Load Optimized Defaults" section in
this chapter or introductions of the battery/clear CMOS jumper in Chapter 1 for how to clear the CMOS values.)
2-1 Startup Screen
The following startup Logo screen will appear when the computer boots.
(Sample BIOS Version: D4)
Function Keys
There are two different BIOS modes as follows and you can use the <F2> key to switch between the two modes.
The Classic Setup mode provides detailed BIOS settings. You can press the arrow keys on your keyboard to move
among the items and press <Enter> to accept or enter a sub-menu. Or you can use your mouse to select the
item you want. Easy Mode allows users to quickly view their current system information or to make adjustments
for optimum performance. In Easy Mode, you can use your mouse to move through configuration items.
• When the system is not stable as usual, select the Load Optimized Defaults item to set your system to its defaults.
• The BIOS Setup menus described in this chapter are for reference only and may differ by BIOS version.

AHCI driver during the Windows installation process. After the operating system is installed, we recommend
that you install all required drivers from the motherboard driver disk using "Xpress Install" to ensure system
performance and compatibility. If the operating system to be installed requires that you provide additional SATA
RAID/AHCI driver during the OS installation process, please refer to the steps below:
1. Copy the Hw10 folder under the \BootDrv folder in the driver disk to your USB thumb drive.
2. Boot from the Windows setup disk and perform standard OS installation steps. When the screen requesting
you to load the driver appears, select Browse.
3. Insert the USB thumb drive and then browse to the location of the driver. The location of the drivers is as
follows:
\Hw10\RAID\x64
4. Select AMD-RAID Bottom Device first and click Next to load the driver. Then select AMD-RAID Controller
and click Next to load the driver. Finally, continue the OS installation.
