Activity LED Switch Connects to the speaker on the chassis front panel. The system
Chassis
Intrusion Header reports system startup status by issuing a beep code. One single
short beep will be heard if no problem is detected at system startup.
• HD (Hard Drive Activity LED, Blue):
Connects to the hard drive activity LED on the chassis front panel. The LED is on when the hard drive
is reading or writing data.
• RES (Reset Switch, Green):
Connects to the reset switch on the chassis front panel. Press the reset switch to restart the computer
if the computer freezes and fails to perform a normal restart.
• CI (Chassis Intrusion Header, Gray):
Connects to the chassis intrusion switch/sensor on the chassis that can detect if the chassis cover
has been removed. This function requires a chassis with a chassis intrusion switch/sensor.
• NC (Orange): No connection.
The front panel design may differ by chassis. A front panel module mainly consists of power
switch, reset switch, power LED, hard drive activity LED, speaker and etc. When connecting
your chassis front panel module to this header, make sure the wire assignments and the pin
assignments are matched correctly.

16) BAT (Battery)
The battery provides power to keep the values (such as BIOS configurations, date, and time information)
in the CMOS when the computer is turned off. Replace the battery when the battery voltage drops to a
low level, or the CMOS values may not be accurate or may be lost.
You may clear the CMOS values by removing the battery:
1. Turn off your computer and unplug the power cord.
2. Gently remove the battery from the battery holder and wait for one minute. (Or use
a metal object like a screwdriver to touch the positive and negative terminals of the
battery holder, making them short for 5 seconds.)
3. Replace the battery.
4. Plug in the power cord and restart your computer.
• Always turn off your computer and unplug the power cord before replacing the battery.
• Replace the battery with an equivalent one. Damage to your devices may occur if the battery
is replaced with an incorrect model.
• Contact the place of purchase or local dealer if you are not able to replace the battery by
yourself or uncertain about the battery model.
• When installing the battery, note the orientation of the positive side (+) and the negative side
(-) of the battery (the positive side should face up).
• Used batteries must be handled in accordance with local environmental regulations.
17) CLR_CMOS (Clear CMOS Jumper)
Use this jumper to clear the BIOS configuration and reset the CMOS values to factory defaults. To clear
the CMOS values, use a metal object like a screwdriver to touch the two pins for a few seconds.

Chapter 2 BIOS Setup
BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) records hardware parameters of the system in the CMOS on the
motherboard. Its major functions include conducting the Power-On Self-Test (POST) during system startup,
saving system parameters and loading operating system, etc. BIOS includes a BIOS Setup program that allows
the user to modify basic system configuration settings or to activate certain system features.
When the power is turned off, the battery on the motherboard supplies the necessary power to the CMOS to
keep the configuration values in the CMOS.
To access the BIOS Setup program, press the <Delete> key during the POST when the power is turned on.
To upgrade the BIOS, use either the GIGABYTE Q-Flash or @BIOS utility.
• Q-Flash allows the user to quickly and easily upgrade or back up BIOS without entering the operating
system.
• @BIOS is a Windows-based utility that searches and downloads the latest version of BIOS from the
Internet and updates the BIOS.
• Because BIOS flashing is potentially risky, if you do not encounter problems using the current version of
BIOS, it is recommended that you not flash the BIOS. To flash the BIOS, do it with caution. Inadequate BIOS
flashing may result in system malfunction.
• It is recommended that you not alter the default settings (unless you need to) to prevent system instability
or other unexpected results. Inadequately altering the settings may result in system's failure to boot. If this
occurs, try to clear the CMOS values and reset the board to default values. (Refer to the "Load Optimized
Defaults" section in this chapter or introductions of the battery/clear CMOS jumper in Chapter 1 for how to
clear the CMOS values.)
2-1 Startup Screen
The following startup Logo screen will appear when the computer boots.
(Sample BIOS Version: T0d)
Function Keys

to select the item you want. Easy Mode allows users to quickly view their current system information or
to make adjustments for optimum performance. In Easy Mode, you can use your mouse to move through
configuration items.
• When the system is not stable as usual, select the Load Optimized Defaults item to set your system to its
defaults.
• The BIOS Setup menus described in this chapter are for reference only and may differ by BIOS version.
