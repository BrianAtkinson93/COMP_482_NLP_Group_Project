16) CLR_CMOS (Clear CMOS Jumper)
Use this jumper to clear the BIOS configuration and reset the CMOS values to factory defaults. To clear
the CMOS values, use a metal object like a screwdriver to touch the two pins for a few seconds.
Open: Normal
Short: Clear CMOS Values
• Always turn off your computer and unplug the power cord from the power outlet before clearing
the CMOS values.
• After system restart, go to BIOS Setup to load factory defaults (select Load Optimized Defaults) or
manually configure the BIOS settings (refer to Chapter 2, "BIOS Setup," for BIOS configurations).
17) BAT (Battery)
The battery provides power to keep the values (such as BIOS configurations, date, and time information)
in the CMOS when the computer is turned off. Replace the battery when the battery voltage drops to a low
level, or the CMOS values may not be accurate or may be lost.
You may clear the CMOS values by removing the battery:
1. Turn off your computer and unplug the power cord.
2. Gently remove the battery from the battery holder and wait for one minute. (Or use a metal
object like a screwdriver to touch the positive and negative terminals of the battery holder,
making them short for 5 seconds.)
3. Replace the battery.
4. Plug in the power cord and restart your computer.
• Always turn off your computer and unplug the power cord before replacing the battery.
• Replace the battery with an equivalent one. Damage to your devices may occur if the battery is
replaced with an incorrect model.
• Contact the place of purchase or local dealer if you are not able to replace the battery by yourself
or uncertain about the battery model.
• When installing the battery, note the orientation of the positive side (+) and the negative side (-)
of the battery (the positive side should face up).
• Used batteries must be handled in accordance with local environmental regulations.

Chapter 2 BIOS Setup
BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) records hardware parameters of the system in the CMOS on the
motherboard. Its major functions include conducting the Power-On Self-Test (POST) during system startup,
saving system parameters and loading operating system, etc. BIOS includes a BIOS Setup program that allows
the user to modify basic system configuration settings or to activate certain system features.
When the power is turned off, the battery on the motherboard supplies the necessary power to the CMOS to
keep the configuration values in the CMOS.
To access the BIOS Setup program, press the <Delete> key during the POST when the power is turned on.
To upgrade the BIOS, use either the GIGABYTE Q-Flash or @BIOS utility.
• Q-Flash allows the user to quickly and easily upgrade or back up BIOS without entering the operating system.
• @BIOS is a Windows-based utility that searches and downloads the latest version of BIOS from the Internet
and updates the BIOS.
• Because BIOS flashing is potentially risky, if you do not encounter problems using the current version of BIOS,
it is recommended that you not flash the BIOS. To flash the BIOS, do it with caution. Inadequate BIOS flashing
may result in system malfunction.
• It is recommended that you not alter the default settings (unless you need to) to prevent system instability or other
unexpected results. Inadequately altering the settings may result in system's failure to boot. If this occurs, try to
clear the CMOS values and reset the board to default values. (Refer to the "Load Optimized Defaults" section in
this chapter or introductions of the battery/clear CMOS jumper in Chapter 1 for how to clear the CMOS values.)
2-1 Startup Screen
The following startup Logo screen will appear when the computer boots.
Function Keys
There are two different BIOS modes as follows and you can use the <F2> key to switch between the two modes.
Easy Mode allows users to quickly view their current system information or to make adjustments for optimum
performance. In Easy Mode, you can use your mouse to move through configuration items. The Advanced Mode
provides detailed BIOS settings. You can press the arrow keys on your keyboard to move among the items
and press <Enter> to accept or enter a sub-menu. Or you can use your mouse to select the item you want.
• When the system is not stable as usual, select the Load Optimized Defaults item to set your system to its defaults.
• The BIOS Setup menus described in this chapter are for reference only and may differ by BIOS version.

Minimum Number of
≥2 2 4
Hard Drives
Number of hard drives * Size of the smallest drive (Number of hard drives/2) *
Array Capacity
Size of the smallest drive Size of the smallest drive
Fault Tolerance No Yes Yes
Before you begin, please prepare the following items:
• At least two SATA hard drives or SSDs. (Note) (To ensure optimal performance, it is recommended that you use
two hard drives with identical model and capacity).
• Windows setup disc.
• Motherboard driver disc.
• A USB thumb drive.
Configuring the Onboard SATA Controller
A. Installing SATA hard drive(s) in your computer
Install the hard drives/SSDs in the SATA/M.2 connectors on the motherboard. Then connect the power connectors
from your power supply to the hard drives.
B. Configuring SATA controller mode in BIOS Setup
Make sure to configure the SATA controller mode correctly in system BIOS Setup.
Steps:
Turn on your computer and press <Delete> to enter BIOS Setup during the POST (Power-On Self-Test). Under
Settings\IO Ports, set SATA Configuration\SATA Mode to RAID. Then save the settings and restart your
computer. (If you want to use NVMe PCIe SSDs to configure RAID, make sure to set NVMe RAID mode to
Enabled.)
The BIOS Setup menus described in this section may differ from the exact settings for your
motherboard. The actual BIOS Setup menu options you will see shall depend on the motherboard
you have and the BIOS version.
C. UEFI RAID Configuration
Steps:
1. In BIOS Setup, go to Boot and set CSM Support to Disabled. Save the changes and exit BIOS Setup.
2. After the system reboot, enter BIOS Setup again. Then enter the Settings\IO Ports\RAIDXpert2
Configuration Utility sub-menu.
3. On the RAIDXpert2 Configuration Utility screen, press <Enter> on Array Management to enter the Create
Array screen. Then, select a RAID level. RAID levels supported include RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 10 (the

Install the RAID driver and operating system
With the correct BIOS settings, you are ready to install the operating system.
Installing the Operating System
As some operating systems already include RAID driver, you do not need to install separate RAID driver during
the Windows installation process. After the operating system is installed, we recommend that you install all
required drivers from the motherboard driver disc using "Xpress Install" to ensure system performance and
compatibility. If the operating system to be installed requires that you provide additional RAID driver during the
OS installation process, please refer to the steps below:
1. Copy the Hw10 folder under the \BootDrv folder in the driver disc to your USB thumb drive.
2. Boot from the Windows setup disc and perform standard OS installation steps. When the screen requesting
you to load the driver appears, select Browse.
3. Insert the USB thumb drive and then browse to the location of the driver. The location of the drivers is as
follows:
\Hw10\RAID\x64
4. Select AMD-RAID Bottom Device first and click Next to load the driver. Then select AMD-RAID Controller
and click Next to load the driver. Finally, continue the OS installation.
Please visit GIGABYTE's website for details on configuring a RAID array.

3-2 Drivers Installation
• Before installing the drivers, first install the operating system.
• After installing the operating system, insert the motherboard driver disc into your optical drive. Click
on the message "Tap to choose what happens with this disc" on the top-right corner of the screen
and select "Run Run.exe." (Or go to My Computer, double-click the optical drive and execute the
Run.exe program.)
"Xpress Install" will automatically scan your system and then list all of the drivers that are recommended to
install. You can click the Xpress Install button and "Xpress Install" will install all of the selected drivers. Or click
the arrow icon to individually install the drivers you need.
