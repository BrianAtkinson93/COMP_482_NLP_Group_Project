• Make sure that the motherboard supports the CPU.
(Go to GIGABYTE's website for the latest CPU support list.)
• Always turn off the computer and unplug the power cord from the power outlet before installing the
CPU to prevent hardware damage.
• Locate the pin one of the CPU. The CPU cannot be inserted if oriented incorrectly.
• Apply an even and thin layer of thermal grease on the surface of the CPU.
• Do not turn on the computer if the CPU cooler is not installed, otherwise overheating and damage
of the CPU may occur.
• Set the CPU host frequency in accordance with the CPU specifications. It is not recommended
that the system bus frequency be set beyond hardware specifications since it does not meet the
standard requirements for the peripherals. If you wish to set the frequency beyond the standard
specifications, please do so according to your hardware specifications including the CPU, graphics
card, memory, hard drive, etc.

17) BAT (Battery)
The battery provides power to keep the values (such as BIOS configurations, date, and time information)
in the CMOS when the computer is turned off. Replace the battery when the battery voltage drops to a low
level, or the CMOS values may not be accurate or may be lost.
You may clear the CMOS values by removing the battery:
1. Turn off your computer and unplug the power cord.
2. Gently remove the battery from the battery holder and wait for one minute. (Or use
a metal object like a screwdriver to touch the positive and negative terminals of the
battery holder, making them short for 5 seconds.)
3. Replace the battery.
4. Plug in the power cord and restart your computer.
• Always turn off your computer and unplug the power cord before replacing the battery.
• Replace the battery with an equivalent one. Damage to your devices may occur if the battery
is replaced with an incorrect model.
• Contact the place of purchase or local dealer if you are not able to replace the battery by yourself
or uncertain about the battery model.
• When installing the battery, note the orientation of the positive side (+) and the negative side (-)
of the battery (the positive side should face up).
• Used batteries must be handled in accordance with local environmental regulations.
18) CLR_CMOS (Clear CMOS Jumper)
Use this jumper to clear the BIOS configuration and reset the CMOS values to factory defaults. To clear
the CMOS values, use a metal object like a screwdriver to touch the two pins for a few seconds.
Open: Normal
Short: Clear CMOS Values
• Always turn off your computer and unplug the power cord from the power outlet before clearing
the CMOS values.
• After system restart, go to BIOS Setup to load factory defaults (select Load Optimized Defaults) or
manually configure the BIOS settings (refer to Chapter 2, "BIOS Setup," for BIOS configurations).
19) QFLASH_PLUS (Q-Flash Plus Button)
Q-Flash Plus allows you to update the BIOS when your system is off (S5 shutdown state). Save the latest
BIOS on a USB thumb drive and plug it into the dedicated port, and then you can now flash the BIOS
automatically by simply pressing the Q-Flash Plus button. The QFLED will flash when the BIOS matching
and flashing activities start and will stop flashing when the main BIOS flashing is complete.

Chapter 2 BIOS Setup
BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) records hardware parameters of the system in the CMOS on the
motherboard. Its major functions include conducting the Power-On Self-Test (POST) during system startup,
saving system parameters and loading operating system, etc. BIOS includes a BIOS Setup program that allows
the user to modify basic system configuration settings or to activate certain system features.
When the power is turned off, the battery on the motherboard supplies the necessary power to the CMOS to
keep the configuration values in the CMOS.
To access the BIOS Setup program, press the <Delete> key during the POST when the power is turned on.
To upgrade the BIOS, use either the GIGABYTE Q-Flash or @BIOS utility.
• Q-Flash allows the user to quickly and easily upgrade or back up BIOS without entering the operating system.
• @BIOS is a Windows-based utility that searches and downloads the latest version of BIOS from the Internet
and updates the BIOS.
• Because BIOS flashing is potentially risky, if you do not encounter problems using the current version of BIOS,
it is recommended that you not flash the BIOS. To flash the BIOS, do it with caution. Inadequate BIOS flashing
may result in system malfunction.
• It is recommended that you not alter the default settings (unless you need to) to prevent system instability or other
unexpected results. Inadequately altering the settings may result in system's failure to boot. If this occurs, try to
clear the CMOS values and reset the board to default values. (Refer to the "Load Optimized Defaults" section in
this chapter or introductions of the battery/clear CMOS jumper in Chapter 1 for how to clear the CMOS values.)
2-1 Startup Screen
The following startup Logo screen will appear when the computer boots.
(Sample BIOS Version: X570 AORUS ELITE, F1a)
Function Keys
There are two different BIOS modes as follows and you can use the <F2> key to switch between the two modes.
Easy Mode allows users to quickly view their current system information or to make adjustments for optimum
performance. In Easy Mode, you can use your mouse to move through configuration items. The Advanced Mode

Minimum Number of ≥2 2 4
Hard Drives
Number of hard drives * Size of the smallest drive (Number of hard drives/2) *
Array Capacity
Size of the smallest drive Size of the smallest drive
Fault Tolerance No Yes Yes
Before you begin, please prepare the following items:
• At least two SATA hard drives or SSDs. (Note) (To ensure optimal performance, it is recommended that you
use two hard drives with identical model and capacity).
• Windows setup disk.
• Motherboard driver disk.
• A USB thumb drive.
Configuring the Onboard SATA Controller
A. Installing SATA hard drive(s) in your computer
Install the hard drives/SSDs in the SATA/M.2 connectors on the motherboard. Then connect the power connectors
from your power supply to the hard drives.
B. Configuring SATA controller mode in BIOS Setup
Make sure to configure the SATA controller mode correctly in system BIOS Setup.
Steps:
Turn on your computer and press <Delete> to enter BIOS Setup during the POST (Power-On Self-Test). Under
Settings\IO Ports, set SATA Configuration\SATA Mode to RAID. Then save the settings and restart your
computer. (If you want to use NVMe PCIe SSDs to configure RAID, make sure to set NVMe RAID mode to
Enabled.)
The BIOS Setup menus described in this section may differ from the exact settings for your motherboard.
The actual BIOS Setup menu options you will see shall depend on the motherboard you have and
the BIOS version.
(Note) An M.2 PCIe SSD cannot be used to set up a RAID set either with an M.2 SATA SSD or a SATA hard
drive.

With the correct BIOS settings, you are ready to install the operating system.
Installing the Operating System
As some operating systems already include RAID/AHCI driver, you do not need to install separate RAID/AHCI
driver during the Windows installation process. After the operating system is installed, we recommend that you
install all required drivers from the motherboard driver disk using "Xpress Install" to ensure system performance
and compatibility. If the operating system to be installed requires that you provide additional SATA RAID/AHCI
driver during the OS installation process, please refer to the steps below:
1. Copy the Hw10 folder under the \Boot folder in the driver disk to your USB thumb drive.
2. Boot from the Windows setup disk and perform standard OS installation steps. When the screen requesting
you to load the driver appears, select Browse.
3. Insert the USB thumb drive and then browse to the location of the driver. The location of the drivers is as
follows:
\Hw10\RAID\x64
4. Select AMD-RAID Bottom Device first and click Next to load the driver. Then select AMD-RAID Controller
and click Next to load the driver. Finally, continue the OS installation.
Please visit GIGABYTE's website for details on configuring a RAID array.
