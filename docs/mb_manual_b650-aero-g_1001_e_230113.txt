1/2) ATX_12V_2X2/ATX_12V/ATX (2x2, 2x4, 12V Power Connectors and 2x12 Main Power Connector)
With the use of the power connector, the power supply can supply enough stable power to all the components
on the motherboard. Before connecting the power connector, first make sure the power supply is turned
off and all devices are properly installed. The power connector possesses a foolproof design. Connect the
power supply cable to the power connector in the correct orientation.
The 12V power connector mainly supplies power to the CPU. If the 12V power connector is not connected,
the computer will not start.
To meet expansion requirements, it is recommended that a power supply that can withstand high
power consumption be used (500W or greater). If a power supply is used that does not provide the
required power, the result can lead to an unstable or unbootable system.

3/4) CPU_FAN/SYS_FAN1/2/3/4 (Fan Headers)
All fan headers on this motherboard are 4-pin. Most fan headers possess a foolproof insertion design.
When connecting a fan cable, be sure to connect it in the correct orientation (the black connector wire is
the ground wire). The speed control function requires the use of a fan with fan speed control design. For
optimum heat dissipation, it is recommended that a system fan be installed inside the chassis.

Follow the steps below to correctly install an M.2 SSD in the M.2 connector.
Step 1:
Unfasten the screws on the motherboard heatsink diagonally to remove the heatsink. Select the M.2 slot
you want to use and press down on the M.2 EZ-Latch clip to open it.
• If you want to install an M.2 SSD that came with its own heatsink, you have to remove the
EZ-Latch clip first and use the provided screw and standoff to fasten the SSD.
• If you want install an M.2 SSD in the 110mm hole that already has a motherboard heatsink
standoff, be sure to remove the EZ-Latch clip first and use the motherboard heatsink screw to
secure the heatsink and SSD.
Step 2:
Insert the M.2 SSD into the M.2 connector at an angle. Press down on the front end of the M.2 SSD and
close M.2 EZ-Latch clip to secure the M.2 SSD.
Step 3:
Remove the protective film from the bottom of the motherboard heatsink and then replace the heatsink
and tighten the screws diagonally.
* Types of M.2 SSDs supported by each M.2 connector:
M.2 PCIe x4 SSD M.2 PCIe x2 SSD M.2 SATA SSD
M2A_CPU a a r
M2B_CPU a a r
M2C_SB a a r
& Please visit GIGABYTE's website for details on using M.2 EZ-Latch.

• PLED/PWR_LED (Power LED):
System Status LED Connects to the power status indicator on the chassis front panel. The LED
S0 On is on when the system is operating. The LED is off when the system is in S3/
S3/S4/S5 Off S4 sleep state or powered off (S5).
• PW (Power Switch):
Connects to the power switch on the chassis front panel. You may configure the way to turn off your
system using the power switch (please navigate to the "BIOS Setup" page of GIGABYTE's website and
search for "Soft-Off by PWR-BTTN" for more information).
• SPEAK (Speaker):
Connects to the speaker on the chassis front panel. The system reports system startup status by issuing
a beep code. One single short beep will be heard if no problem is detected at system startup.
• HD (Hard Drive Activity LED):
Connects to the hard drive activity LED on the chassis front panel. The LED is on when the hard drive
is reading or writing data.
• RES (Reset Switch):
Connects to the reset switch on the chassis front panel. Press the reset switch to restart the computer
if the computer freezes and fails to perform a normal restart.
• CI (Chassis Intrusion Header):
Connects to the chassis intrusion switch/sensor on the chassis that can detect if the chassis cover has
been removed. This function requires a chassis with a chassis intrusion switch/sensor.
• NC: No connection.
The front panel design may differ by chassis. A front panel module mainly consists of power switch,
reset switch, power LED, hard drive activity LED, speaker and etc. When connecting your chassis
front panel module to this header, make sure the wire assignments and the pin assignments are
matched correctly.

Chapter 3 BIOS Setup
BIOS (Basic Input and Output System) records hardware parameters of the system in the CMOS on the
motherboard. Its major functions include conducting the Power-On Self-Test (POST) during system startup,
saving system parameters and loading operating system, etc. BIOS includes a BIOS Setup program that allows
the user to modify basic system configuration settings or to activate certain system features.
When the power is turned off, the battery on the motherboard supplies the necessary power to the CMOS to
keep the configuration values in the CMOS.
To access the BIOS Setup program, press the <Delete> key during the POST when the power is turned on.
To upgrade the BIOS, use either the GIGABYTE Q-Flash or Q-Flash Plus utility.
• Q-Flash allows the user to quickly and easily upgrade or back up BIOS without entering the operating system.
• Q-Flash Plus allows you to update the BIOS when your system is off (S5 shutdown state). Save the latest
BIOS on a USB thumb drive and plug it into the dedicated port, and then you can now flash the BIOS
automatically by simply pressing the Q-Flash Plus button.
For instructions on using the Q-Flash and Q-Flash Plus utilities, please navigate to the "Unique Features" page
of GIGABYTE's website and search for "BIOS Update Utilities."
• Because BIOS flashing is potentially risky, if you do not encounter problems using the current
version of BIOS, it is recommended that you not flash the BIOS. To flash the BIOS, do it with
caution. Inadequate BIOS flashing may result in system malfunction.
• It is recommended that you not alter the default settings (unless you need to) to prevent system
instability or other unexpected results. Inadequately altering the settings may result in system's
failure to boot. If this occurs, try to clear the CMOS values and reset the board to default values.
• Refer to the introductions of the battery/clear CMOS jumper in Chapter 2 or navigate to the "BIOS
Setup" page of GIGABYTE's website and search for "Load Optimized Defaults" for how to clear
the CMOS values.
& Please visit GIGABYTE's website for details on configuring BIOS Setup.

Chapter 4 Installing the Operating System and Drivers
4-1 Operating System Installation
With the correct BIOS settings, you are ready to install the operating system.
As some operating systems already include RAID driver, you do not need to install separate RAID driver during
the Windows installation process. After the operating system is installed, we recommend that you install all
required drivers from the GIGABYTE Control Center to ensure system performance and compatibility. If the
operating system to be installed requires that you provide additional RAID driver during the OS installation
process, please refer to the steps below:
Step 1:
Go to GIGABYTE's website, browse to the motherboard model's web page, download the AMD RAID Preinstall
Driver file on the Support\Download\SATA RAID/AHCI page, unzip the file and copy the files to your USB
thumb drive.
Step 2:
Boot from the Windows setup disc and perform standard OS installation steps. When the screen requesting you
to load the driver appears, select Browse.
Step 3:
Insert the USB thumb drive and then browse to the location of the driver. Select AMD-RAID Bottom Device first
and click Next to load the driver. Then select AMD-RAID Controller and click Next to load the driver. Finally,
continue the OS installation.
- 36 -
4-2 Drivers Installation
After you install the operating system, a dialog box will appear on the bottom-right corner of the desktop asking
if you want to download and install the drivers and GIGABYTE applications via GIGABYTE Control Center
(GCC). Click Install to proceed with the installation. (In BIOS Setup, make sure Settings\Gigabyte Utilities
Downloader Configuration\Gigabyte Utilities Downloader is set to Enabled.)

FCC Compliance Statement:
This device complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules, Subpart B, Unintentional Radiators.
Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) This device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this
device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.
The FCC with its action in ET Docket 96-8 has adopted a safety standard for human exposure to radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic energy emitted
by FCC certified equipment. The Intel PRO/Wireless 5000 LAN products meet the Human Exposure limits found in OET Bulletin 65, 2001, and ANSI/
IEEE C95.1, 1992. Proper operation of this radio according to the instructions found in this manual will result in exposure substantially below the FCC's
recommended limits.
The following safety precautions should be observed:
• Do not touch or move antenna while the unit is transmitting or receiving.
• Do not hold any component containing the radio such that the antenna is very close or touching any exposed parts of the body, especially the face
or eyes, while transmitting.
• Do not operate the radio or attempt to transmit data unless the antenna is connected; if not, the radio may be damaged.
• Use in specific environments:
- The use of wireless devices in hazardous locations is limited by the constraints posed by the safety directors of such environments.
- The use of wireless devices on airplanes is governed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
- The use of wireless devices in hospitals is restricted to the limits set forth by each hospital.
